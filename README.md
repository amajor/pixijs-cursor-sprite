# PIXI.js - Cursor Interactions

These are just some simple interactions with PIXI.js and the cursor as I learn how it works.

If you use VS Code, installing [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server) and then pressing "Go Live" will then run your [index.html](./index.html) which links to the following:

- [Laser Cursor](./laser_cursor.html) - this gives a user icon and some text details that follow the cursor
- [Custom Cursor](./custom_cursor.html) - this sets the cursor on the canvas to a custom cursor
- [Sprite-Follows-Cursor](./sprite_follows_mouse.html) - this has a sprite following your mouse around the screen _(uses PIXI.js v5.2.0)_.
